---- DFRobot 

    IRamera and general tech stuff.
    
---- Emulation Station, Recallbox, RetroPie all the frontends

    It would nt be nearly as nice without a frontend.
    
---- RetroArch, Dolphin, Sameboy, Mupen64 all emulators.

    Lightguns wouldnt really be useful without the emus for your games.
