# Freguently Asked Questions

     - Do I need different code for different type?
        
          No code applys to all types. different types have things plug into different spots.
          
     - Can I buy it premade?
     
          Thats the goal in time lol.
          
     - Can I help with development?
     
          If you are a coder please fork and pull request. 
          
          If you wanna donate $$. ATM I dont have anything setup to accept monetary donations.
          
     - Why though? Thiers already lightguns out thier.
     
          I dont like the limit of buttons, attachments and designs on current choices.
