# Build Instructions Will Vary GREATLY Depending on what shell/gun you are using.

      Heres a basic how to. AGAIN THIS WILL PER GUN.

      - Figure out how many buttons you want.
      
            If just a few see Fusion Volt: https://github.com/Fusion-Lightguns/Fusion-Volt

      - Figure out where you want buttons at.
      
      - Pull apart gun.
      
      - Figure out where you are gonna mount the micro processor at.
      
      - Make sure your buttons will work.
      
      - Figure out where your wiring is going 
      
      - Figure out what "Extras" you want. Example vib motor , power leds that kind of stuff.
            
      - Drill holes for buttons if necessary.
      
      - Mount your micro processor
      
      - Wire it all up 
      
      - Check your connections BEFORE closing gun back up. Plug in to pc/pi and test. 
      
            The calibration ISNT important atm. Just test that buttons & camera are working
      
      - Close Gun back up.
