## VERSION 1.00 - 1.99

#  Version 1.00 12/2/22

     - Named Fusion Phasers 

     - Purchased a DIY kit to reverse engineer and learn.
     
     - Finished 3D design of sides of Lightgun
     
     - Built a gun from DIY ki. It was as i epected mostly
     
     - Ordered all basic parts today. Will be begin testing when they arrive
     
     - Decided to use Pi Pico as "Brains" 
     
     - Figured out almost everything needed
     
#  12/10/22

     - Started to build a kickstarter for Fusion Phaser 
     
     - Switched on gun dpad to a wii nunchuck hookup. 
     
     - Added buttons on each side . 2 buttons on each side plus trigger = 5 buttona in total
     
# 12/10/22
     
          - I cant get Pico Pi to work in Arduino IDE. Porbably gonan switch to Arduino Pro 32u4
          
          - Test gun is almost complete.
          

# 12/17/22

     - Prototype gun finished printing soooo cool . 
     
     - Got a few Pro Micros 32u4 to test on . 
     
     - Ordered a Itsty Bitsty 32u4 5V

     - So far cursor stuck in top left corner lol. (Will work it out)
     
     - Uploaded my ino files to thiss github. WORK IN PROGRESS
     
     
# Version 1.02 12/21/22

    - Got a working prototype of Fusion Volt.
    
    - Tested all extra code and buttons for Phaser. Was fine. 
    
    - Making avaible for multiple boards. Currently Pro Micro 32u4 5V & Itsty Bitsy 32u4
    
    - Ordered stuff to capture videos
    
    - Made more progress on kickstarter . ( Waiting till really ready to launch)
    
# Version 1.03 12/23/22

    - Found some awesome enchancements we are gonna use. https://github.com/Prow7/ir-light-gun
    
Prow7 Enhancements

     - Increased precision for maths and mouse pointer position

     - Glitch-free DFRobot positioning (DFRobotIRPositionEx library)

     - IR camera sensitivity adjustment (DFRobotIRPositionEx library)

     - Faster IIC clock option for IR camera (DFRobotIRPositionEx library)

     - Optional averaging modes can be enabled to slightly reduce mouse position jitter

     - Enhanced button debouncing and handling (LightgunButtons library)

     - Modified AbsMouse to be a 5 button device (AbsMouse5 library)

     - Multiple calibration profiles

     - Save settings and calibration profiles to flash memory (SAMD) or EEPROM (ATmega32U4)
     
     - Built in Processing mode for use with the SAMCO Processing sketch


# 12/27/22

     - Changed buttons to make more retropie and gaming freindly.
     
     - Escape, Enter, F4, & Alt mapped now. Instead of extra mouse buttons. 
     
     - Renamed Reload to Calibrate in Code.
     
     - Renamed Pedal to Reload in Code.
     
     - Tested on two pro micro same time worked fine 
     
     - Figured out how to make leonardo appear as Fusion Phaser.
     
     - Nunchuck hooked removed for now . Will have a hand controller custom made with dpad and 2 buttons. 
     
     - Stable tested first release now on github.
